# ChatEase
My twelfth grade project

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I've created an exe for the client and the server (in the exe folder)
So all you need to do to run the client or the server is download the exe and run it.


In case you don't want to run the exe and you prefer running the python files directly:

1. Both in client & server folder there is a file called requirements.txt which specifies all the libraries that you need to install for python.
2. Tested on python version 3.11.2
3. To run the server, run the server main file - ServerGUI.py (in server folder)
4. To run the client, run the client main file - ChatEaseGUI.py (in client folder)
